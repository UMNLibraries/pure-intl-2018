              Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. One goes into the ﬁrst room, and it’s dark, completely dark. One stumbles around bumping into the furniture, and gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is, and ﬁnally, after six months or so, you ﬁnd the light switch.

            <h2>Bounded Rationality</h2>
            <p>Extended quotation on the "Impossibility of Unfamiliar Optimization When Decision Time Is Scarce" follows.
          </section>
  
          <section>
            <h2>Impossibility of Unfamiliar Optimization ...</h2>
            <p>
              In the case of an unfamiliar problem, the decision maker must devise a
              method for finding the alternative to be chosen before it can be applied. This
              leads to two levels of decision-making activities which both take time:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Level 1</em>: Finding the alternative to be chosen.<br>
              <em>Level 2</em>: Finding a method for Level 1.
            </p>
          </section>
  
          <section>
            <h2>Impossibility of Unfamiliar Optimization ...</h2>
            <p>
              What is the optimal approach to the problem of Level 2? One can hardly imagine
              that this problem is familiar. Presumably a decision maker who does not immediately
              know what to do on Level 1 will also not be familiar with the task of
              Level 2. Therefore, some time must be spent to find an optimal method for solving
              the task of Level 2. Thus we arrive at Level 3.

            <h2>Impossibility of Unfamiliar Optimization ...</h2>
            <p>
              It is clear that in this way we obtain an infinite sequence of levels <em>k</em> = 2, 3 , ...
              provided that finding an optimal method for Level <em>k</em> continues to be unfamiliar
              for every <em>k</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Level k</em>: Finding a method for Level <em>k</em> - 1.

              Promising a minimum viable product (MVP) in two weeks may work well for a greenfield
              project, but is probably unrealistic for most integration projects.

  						<q cite="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/">
                Rationalists claim that there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience. Empiricists claim that sense experience is the ultimate source of all our concepts and knowledge.
